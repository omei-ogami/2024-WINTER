# Week 3: Learning Relational Databases

## Objective
Understand the fundamentals of relational databases, learn how to design a relational schema, and familiarize yourself with SQL queries. This week will focus on learning the theoretical concepts and practicing SQL. Also, Java will be inquired about the implementation of the database schema and SQL queries.

## Tasks

You don't need to implement any code for this week, but you should use the resources below to learn and practice SQL. The lab next week will be based on these concepts.

### 1. **Database Fundamentals**
- Learn the basics of **relational databases**:
  - Understand entities, attributes, and relationships.
  - Learn about **primary keys** and **foreign keys**.
  - Explore **normalization** (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to reduce data redundancy.
  
### 2. **Designing a Relational Schema**
- Learn how to design a relational schema:
  - Identify the necessary tables (e.g., Users, Products, Reviews, Interactions).
  - Establish relationships between tables using **foreign keys**.
  - Design an efficient schema that can support scalable queries for a recommendation system.

### 3. **SQL Queries**
- Learn basic SQL syntax:
  - Write **SELECT** queries to retrieve data from one table.
  - Use **JOIN** to combine data from multiple tables (e.g., users and reviews).
  - Practice writing **aggregate queries** to calculate averages, counts, and groupings (e.g., average ratings for products).

### 4. **Database Normalization**
- Study the principles of **database normalization** and why itâ€™s important for reducing redundancy.
  - Normalize a sample database schema to 1NF, 2NF, and 3NF.

### 5. **Database Indexing**
- Understand the concept of **indexes** in relational databases:
  - Learn how indexing improves query performance.
  - Practice creating and using indexes for frequently queried columns.

## Bonus
Do these if time permits:
- Explore **subqueries** and **nested queries**.
- Study advanced SQL features like **window functions** and **stored procedures**.
  
## Learning Goals
- Learn the basics of relational databases and SQL.
- Understand how to design an efficient relational database schema.
- Familiarize yourself with basic SQL operations, including querying and joins.
- Learn about database normalization and indexing.

## Resources
- **Databases:**
  - SQLZoo, W3Schools SQL tutorials.
- **Tools:**
  - MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite (based on your preference).
  - SQL management tools (pgAdmin, DB Browser for SQLite).
- **References:**
  - SQL documentation (PostgreSQL or SQLite).
  - Database normalization and optimization tutorials.
