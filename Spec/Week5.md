# Week 5: Sentiment Analysis with NLP

## Objective
This week will focus on mastering the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a particular emphasis on sentiment analysis using Transformer-based models like BERT. You will also dive deeper into key NLP concepts, text preprocessing techniques, and learn how Transformer models revolutionized NLP tasks like sentiment classification.

## Tasks

We will not implement our model this week, but you should familiarize yourself with the key concepts and techniques used in NLP and sentiment analysis. The lab next week will be based on these concepts and techniques, and you will have to implement a transformer-based sentiment analysis model from scratch.

### 1. **Deep Dive into NLP Fundamentals**
- Study **NLP** core concepts:
  - **Tokenization**: Explore different tokenization techniques such as word-level, subword-level, and sentence-level tokenization.
  - **Text Preprocessing**: Understand how to clean and preprocess text data (e.g., removing stopwords, handling punctuation, lowercasing, and stemming).
  - **Text Representation**:
    - Learn about traditional techniques like **Bag of Words** and **TF-IDF**.
    - Study modern embedding methods like **Word2Vec** and **GloVe** for word representation.
  
### 2. **Introduction to Transformer Models**
- Learn the architecture behind **Transformer models**:
  - Study the attention mechanism and **self-attention** in detail.
  - Understand how transformers address issues like long-range dependencies better than traditional RNNs and LSTMs.
  - Learn how **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** works, and why bidirectional context is powerful for text understanding.
  
### 3. **Pre-trained Transformer Models and Fine-tuning**
- Dive into **Hugging Face's Transformers** library:
  - Explore how pre-trained models like **BERT**, **RoBERTa**, and **DistilBERT** can be used for sentiment analysis.
  - Learn how to **fine-tune** these models on a custom dataset (e.g., Amazon product reviews), adjusting hyperparameters for optimal performance.
  - Understand the concept of **transfer learning** and how it significantly reduces training time and computational resources.
  
### 4. **Sentiment Analysis Theory**
- Understand the core concepts of **sentiment analysis**:
  - Learn about sentiment classes: positive, negative, and neutral.
  - Study techniques for sentiment labeling in text data.
  - Explore different approaches to sentiment analysis, from traditional machine learning classifiers to deep learning models like BERT.

### 5. **Data Preprocessing for Sentiment Analysis**
- Learn how to prepare and format Amazon product reviews for use with sentiment analysis models:
  - **Text Cleaning**: Remove unnecessary characters, special symbols, and irrelevant words.
  - **Tokenization and Vectorization**: Use `Hugging Face` or `spacy` to tokenize text and convert it into embeddings compatible with Transformer models.
  - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets for model training and evaluation.

### 6. **Explore Model Evaluation Metrics**
- Understand and explore evaluation metrics for sentiment analysis models:
  - **Accuracy**: Basic measure of classification correctness.
  - **Precision, Recall, and F1-score**: For evaluating imbalanced classes.
  - **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize model performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Learning Goals
- Gain a comprehensive understanding of the theory and practice of **NLP**, with a focus on sentiment analysis.
- Master **Transformer models** (especially BERT) and learn how to fine-tune them for sentiment analysis tasks.
- Gain practical experience in **text preprocessing**, including tokenization and vectorization.
- Learn how to evaluate sentiment analysis models and understand their performance metrics.

## Resources
- **Tools and Libraries**: `Hugging Face` Transformers, `pytorch`, `scikit-learn`, `spacy`.
- **Reading Materials**:
  - BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding.
  - Hugging Face documentation on fine-tuning pre-trained models.
  - Papers and tutorials on sentiment analysis and transfer learning in NLP.
