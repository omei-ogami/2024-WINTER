# Week 2: Image Recommendations

## Objective
Recommend products based on visual similarity using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and **Transfer Learning**. The system will use pre-trained models to extract image features and compare them to recommend visually similar products.

## Tasks

These are the tasks you should complete in this week:

### 1. **Data Preparation**
- Download a dataset containing product images (e.g., Amazon Review Data with images or another open dataset).
- Preprocess the images:
  - Resize images to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 for CNN input).
  - Normalize the images to a standard range (e.g., 0-1 or -1 to 1).
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets if necessary.

### 2. **Feature Extraction with Pre-trained CNN using Transfer Learning**
- Load a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet) using a deep learning framework like Keras or PyTorch.
- **Transfer Learning**:
  - Use the pre-trained model as a feature extractor by removing the final classification layer.
  - Extract feature vectors for the product images from the output of the penultimate layer.
  - Fine-tune the model on your dataset if necessary to adapt the model to the specific characteristics of product images.
- Store these feature vectors for later similarity comparison.

### 3. **Image Similarity Calculation**
- Compute image similarity based on the feature vectors:
  - Use cosine similarity or Euclidean distance to measure similarity between image feature vectors.
- For a given query image, find the most similar images in the dataset.

### 4. **Recommendation System**
- Given a user's product preference (e.g., an image of a product they liked), recommend visually similar products based on the calculated image similarity.
- Display a set of recommended products for the user.

### 5. **Evaluation**
- Evaluate the recommendations using a basic metric like Precision@K (for top-K recommendations).
- Optionally, calculate the average similarity score for the top recommendations.

## Bonus
Do these if time permits:
- Fine-tune the pre-trained CNN on a small subset of the product images to improve feature extraction.
- Experiment with different pre-trained models and compare their performance in terms of recommendation quality.
- Implement an interactive interface to upload and compare images for recommendations.

## Learning Goals
- Understand the concept of image-based recommendation systems.
- Learn how to use Transfer Learning to adapt pre-trained models for feature extraction in new domains (e.g., product images).
- Learn to extract features from images using pre-trained CNNs.
- Familiarize yourself with measuring similarity between images.
- Explore how visual similarity can be used to recommend products.
