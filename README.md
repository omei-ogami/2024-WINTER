# [2024 WINTER] Amazon Products Recommendation System
This is a side project of 2024 Winter vacation. The objective is to build a simple recommendation system.  There are 6 checkpoints to be done in 7 weeks, each is expected to complete in 1 week.

## Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive learning and implementation journey through Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Databases (DB), with a focus on building a robust recommendation system. The final output will integrate multiple models and techniques into a cohesive recommendation engine, suitable for diverse applications.

## Week-by-Week Plan

The detailed spec will write in each checkpoint.

- **[ML] Week 1: Recommendation System**
  - **Time**: 12/29 ~ 1/4
    
  - **Objective**: Implement a collaborative filtering recommendation system using Amazon Review Data.
  - **Learning**: Recommendation Task.
 

- **[CNN] Week 2: Image Recommendations**
  - **Time**: 1/5 ~ 1/11
    
  - **Objective**: Recommend products based on visual similarity using CNNs.
  - **Learning**: Transfer learning with pre-trained.
 
- **[DB] Week 3-4: Relational Databases**
  - **Time**: 1/12 ~ 1/25
    
  - **Objective**: Design and implement a database to manage user and product interaction data.
  - **Learning**: Foundational understanding of relational databases and SQL.

- **[RNN] Week 5-6: Sentiment Analysis**
  - **Time**: 1/26 ~ 2/8
    
  - **Objective**: Leverage text reviews to improve recommendations by incorporating sentiment analysis.
  - **Learning**: NLP with transformer-based model.
 
- **[ML] Week 7: Multi-Modal Recommendation System**
  - **Time**: 2/9 ~ 2/15
    
  - **Objective**: Combine collaborative filtering, CNN-based image features, and text-based sentiment analysis into a unified recommendation engine.
  - **Learning**: Integration of multiple models and techniques.
